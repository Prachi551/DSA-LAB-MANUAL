# Experiment 2: Complexity Drill (Operation Counting)
# 1. Time Complexity

# Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with input size.

# 2. Space Complexity

# Space complexity measures how much memory an algorithm uses.

# 3. Single Loop

# A single loop runs n times.
# Time Complexity = O(n)

# 4. Nested Loop 

# Two loops each running n times.
# Total operations = n × n
# Time Complexity = O(n²)

# 5. Halving Loop

# The value is divided by 2 in every step.
# Number of steps = log n
# Time Complexity = O(log n)
