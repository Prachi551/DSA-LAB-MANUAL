Experiment 1 
1. What is an ADT?
An ADT (Abstract Data Type) is a logical description of a data type that defines:
What operations can be performed. But not how those operations are implemented It focuses on behavior, not implementation.
For example, Stack ADT defines operations like push, pop, and peek, but it does not specify whether the stack is implemented using an array or a linked list.

2. Why can push/pop be O(1)?
Push and pop operations in a stack take O(1) time because:
They operate only on the top element. No traversal of elements is required. Only one insertion or deletion is performed.
Since the time does not depend on the size of the stack, the complexity is constant.

3. One real-world use of stack?
One real-world use of a stack is:
Undo/Redo feature in applications. 

Experiment 2 
1. Big-O vs Big-Theta difference?
Big-O (O) represents the upper bound of an algorithm’s time complexity.
It tells us the worst-case growth rate.
Big-Theta (Θ) represents the exact bound (tight bound).
It gives both upper and lower bounds of growth.

2. What does worst-case represent?
Worst-case represents the maximum number of operations an algorithm can perform for a given input size.
It shows the slowest possible performance of the algorithm.
Example:
In linear search, worst case occurs when the element is at the last position or not present.

3. Why does complexity matter in real systems?
Complexity matters because:
It affects performance and speed. It affects memory usage. It helps choose efficient algorithms. In large systems, inefficient algorithms can slow down or crash the system
Efficient algorithms save time and resources.

Experiment 3
1. What is recursion depth?
Recursion depth is the number of times a recursive function calls itself before reaching the base case.
It represents the maximum number of active function calls in the call stack at any time.
For example, in factorial(5), the recursion depth is 5.

2. Why does recursion use stack memory?
Recursion uses stack memory because:
Every function call is stored in the call stack. The stack keeps track of local variables, parameters, and return addresses.
When a recursive function calls itself, a new stack frame is created.
All these frames are stored until the base case is reached.

3. When is iteration better than recursion?
Iteration is better when:
The problem does not naturally require recursion. 
Memory usage needs to be minimized.Recursion depth can be very large (to avoid stack overflow).
Iteration usually uses less memory than recursion.

Experiment 4 
1. Why is naive Fibonacci slow?
Naive Fibonacci is slow because it recalculates the same subproblems multiple times.
For example, to compute F(5):
It calculates F(4) and F(3)
F(4) again calculates F(3) and F(2)
So, F(3) is computed more than once.
This repetition causes the number of function calls to grow exponentially.
Time Complexity = O(2ⁿ)

2. Is memoization related to Dynamic Programming (DP)?
Yes

3. What is the space impact of memoization?
Memoization uses extra memory to store computed values.
Time complexity improves (from O(2ⁿ) to O(n))
But space complexity increases to O(n)
It uses:
O(n) space for storing results
O(n) recursion stack space

Experiment 5
1. Why are moves equal to 2ⁿ − 1? (Tower of Hanoi)
In Tower of Hanoi:
To move n disks, we:
Move (n−1) disks to auxiliary rod
Move 1 largest disk
Move (n−1) disks again
So recurrence relation is:
T(n) = 2T(n−1) + 1
When solved, it becomes: T(n) = 2ⁿ − 1
That is why minimum number of moves is 2ⁿ − 1.

2. What is recursion tree idea?
A recursion tree is a diagram that shows:
How recursive calls are made
How the problem is divided into smaller subproblems
Each node represents a function call.
It helps in analyzing time complexity, especially in algorithms like Fibonacci.

3. Practical risk of exponential algorithms?
Exponential algorithms (like O(2ⁿ)):
Grow very fast as input increases
Become extremely slow for large inputs
Can cause high CPU usage
May lead to system slowdown or crash
They are not practical for large-scale real systems.

Experiment 6
1. Why is sorted data required?
Sorted data is required because binary search works by:
Comparing the middle element
Eliminating half of the remaining elements
This elimination is only possible if the data is in sorted order.
If the data is not sorted, we cannot decide which half to discard.

2. Best / Average / Worst Case?
Best Case:
Minimum number of operations.
Example: In binary search, best case is O(1) when the middle element is the key.
Average Case:
Expected number of operations for a typical input.
For binary search → O(log n).
Worst Case:
Maximum number of operations.
For binary search → O(log n).

3. Divide & Conquer meaning?
Divide and Conquer is a strategy where:
The problem is divided into smaller subproblems.
Each subproblem is solved recursively.
The results are combined to get the final solution.
Example: Binary Search, Merge Sort.
